# Keep-Practice, A Mod of Google Keep


What does an ideal Note app in my mind look like? Google Keep has given an answer, that is Clean and Flexible like a breeze.  
Currently I need a Note app to help me remember some stuff like acrimonius words or APIs.  
What I wanna do is to write it down quickly as a noteüìù once I think the stuff is valuable.  
Also I could attach some labelsüè∑ to my notes in order to catalog them.  
So I am making my own Google Keep with a few enhancements such as a self-examination feature where I review the stuff by typing.  
That's why I call it Keep-Practice.  
Considering I am working on a Material Design UI project with vue [mym-UI](https://github.com/KyLoc20/mym-UI), I build this project with my handmade "bricks". Challenging and exciting.
